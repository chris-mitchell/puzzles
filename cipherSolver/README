This script uses some language heuristics to determine the original result from a basic ROTN cipher.

We first encode a string in a rotation of the users choosing, then we build the percentage of each valid characters in the given string,
we then attempt to get the closest match to a given character (E is the best). Once we found a match, we determine the rotation.

Ideally, we found the correct match and can rotate back to reveal the original message.

Note: Strings must be sufficiently long to be able to be determined. Around 500+ characters usually works. 

Sample output:
Sample String: Washington had a vision of a great...truncated
Sample Cipher: Jnfuvatgba unq n ivfvba bs n terng...truncated
Guessed rotation of: 13
Original String: Washington had a vision of a great...truncated
